Some functions were taken from StandardJSFunctions.js, provided by the instructor.
Some code (HTML,CSS,JS) was adapted from w3schools.com

Image zoom and transition was adapted from https://w3bits.com/css-image-hover-zoom/

------------------
This assignment used many techniques previously used from other assignments in this class.
My CalculateOrder() was adapted from my CakeOrderForm in partC of the midterm project.

For PartA, the architect biographies, I opted to make my image zoom 50% instead of 25% to make it look better since the images were small to begin with.
