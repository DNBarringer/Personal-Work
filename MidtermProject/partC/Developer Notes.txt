Some functions were taking from SAIT's StandardFunctions library, the rest are original from me

I could not get my prices to match up exactly with the documents.
In the assignment it says "Cost of first layer is 549 x 0.02 = 10.98 + $15 = 25.98. The additional layer is 12.99 for a total of $38.98"
So there must be some rounding that is not shown.
My program only rounds the cake area down to the nearest integer as shown in the document, and rounds the final cake price to 2 signifigant digits.
